# QRcodeGenerator
A web-based application for generating QR codes from user-provided URLs, built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. This project extends a CLI-based QR code generator into a web application with an Express server, allowing users to input URLs through a form and receive QR code images for download.
